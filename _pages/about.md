I a member of Technical Staff at [Moonshot AI](https://www.moonshot.cn/).

Previously,  I was a research intern in the [HKUST](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk), advised by [Prof. Binhang Yuan](https://binhangyuan.github.io/site/). Before that, I conducted a remote research internship under the supervision of [Prof. Siqiang Luo](http://siqiangluo.com/) at [NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse). I hold both a B.S. and an M.S. in Computer Science from Fudan University.

<!-- ## Research Experiences

- **CE-LoRA: Computation-Efficient LoRA Fine-Tuning for Language Models [preprint]**\
  *Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, (03/2024 - 01/2025)*\
  *Collaborated with [Prof. Binhang Yuan](https://binhangyuan.github.io/site/) and [Prof. Kun Yuan](https://kunyuan827.github.io)*
  - **Algorithm Development:** Developed *CE-LoRA*, a high-efficiency algorithm for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which significantly reduced backpropagation costs in large language model training. By leveraging structured sparsity and low-rank approximation techniques, the model achieved a $3.39\times$ improvement in training efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.  
  - **Theoretical Analysis:** Conducted a rigorous convergence analysis, proving that *CE-LoRA* maintains the same convergence rate as LoRA, but with reduced computational overhead.


- **Oasis: An Optimal Disjoint Segmented Learned Range Filter [VLDB 24]**\
  *Nanyang Technological University, (02/2023 - 11/2023)*\
  *Collaborated with [Prof. Siqiang Luo](http://siqiangluo.com/) and [Dr. Meng Li](https://njulimn.github.io)*
  - **Oasis:** Developed *Oasis*, a learned range filter that segments the key space into non-overlapping intervals and maps data into a bitmap using a linear model-simulated CDF as the hash function. The filter utilizes block-based Elias-Fano compression to reduce space overhead without compromising query efficiency.  
  - **Oasis+:** Created *Oasis+*, a hybrid range filter that combines learning-based and hash-based methods to enhance filter applicability and robustness across various workloads.  
  - **Integration into RocksDB:** Integrated *Oasis* and *Oasis+* into RocksDB and tested their performance, achieving up to $6.2\times$ improvement in query response times.

- **Gar: A Generate-and-Rank Approach for Natural Language to SQL Translation [ICDE 23]**\
  *Fudan University, (07/2021 - 02/2022)*\
  *Collaborated with [Prof. X. Sean Wang](https://daslab.fudan.edu.cn/61/83/c26852a287107/page.htm)*
  - **Text2SQL Framework Development:** Developed the GAR framework for Text2SQL translation, using a unique "Generate-and-Rank" approach that leverages parsing, generation, and ranking strategies for high-accuracy SQL generation from natural language queries.
  - **Benchmarking:** Built and tested a complex benchmark with self-joins, analyzing GAR's performance against other end-to-end models, providing crucial insights into its strengths in complex query generation. -->
