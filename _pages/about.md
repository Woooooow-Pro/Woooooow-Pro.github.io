I am a second-year CS Graduate student at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) under the guidance of Prof. Zhenying He. Currently, I am engaged in a remote research internship supervised by Prof. [Binhang Yuan](https://binhangyuan.github.io/site/) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk).

Prior to my internship with Prof. Yuan, I served as a research intern at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse),  where I worked under the mentorship of Prof. [Siqiang Luo](http://siqiangluo.com/). I got my bachelor degree from Computer Science Department at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) guided by Prof. Zhenying He for research.

**As I look forward to pursuing a PhD, slated for Fall Intake 2025**, I am eager to explore various research topics and opportunities. If you'd like to connect and discuss potential collaborations or research topics, please don't hesitate to reach out!

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and data-intensive systems. 
<!-- My overarching goal is to pioneer the development of a comprehensive system or toolkit that not only simplifies the research of the AI but also expedites the entire process â€” from environmental deployment and configuration to training and inferencing acceleration - making AI more accessible and efficient. -->


<!-- Previously, my research focused on utilizing machine learning methods to enhance the ability of data-intensive systems. Now, I am looking forward to a research opportunity to build a system to support today's enormous AI models. -->
