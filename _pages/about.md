I am a second-year CS Graduate student at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) advised by Prof. Zhenying He. Currently, I am conducting remote research internship under the supervision of Prof. [Siqiang Luo](http://siqiangluo.com/) at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse).

Before the graduate school, I got my bachelor degree from Computer Science Department at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) guided by Prof. Zhenying He for research.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and data-intensive systems. My overarching goal is to pioneer the development of a comprehensive system or toolkit that not only simplifies the research of the AI but also expedites the entire process —- from environmental deployment and configuration to training and inferencing acceleration —- making AI more accessible and efficient.


<!-- Previously, my research focused on utilizing machine learning methods to enhance the ability of data-intensive systems. Now, I am looking forward to a research opportunity to build a system to support today's enormous AI models. -->
